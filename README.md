# BingBackground
BingBackground is a small command-line program that downloads the Bing homepage image and sets it as your desktop background. Images are saved in your picture directory in a folder named "Bing Backgrounds".

## Usage
Clone the GitHub repo and run the executable found [here](https://github.com/josueespinosa/BingBackground/tree/master/BingBackground/BingBackground/bin/Release), or download the executable and dll file *only* from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8bo8ihOy3gLfjJ2R1dxU0ZDU0hOc1ZJdTFHd0dHN0g1VjlueWV0OWF5YWNFa0pQX1E3WTg&usp=sharing).

##Configuration
You can configure what type of background position you'd like using the App.config file found [here](https://github.com/josueespinosa/BingBackground/blob/master/BingBackground/BingBackground/App.config). Valid options are "Tile", "Center", "Stretch", "Fit", and "Fill". The default is "Fill".

##Future Features:
- Add custom resolution configuration
- Add more robust try/catch error handling
- Add offline check to avoid unnecessary attempts/crashes
- Add UI for config edits
- Automatically launch at configured frequency/time
- Clean up unnecessary files in the repo
- Include installer/uninstaller
- Multiple monitor support (customize same background, or different days on different monitors)
